# Recomedation_System
The project is about using ML and DL models for recomending the movies for user from a dataset of 10000 popular movies
This project includes 2 techniques:
- Content-based system
- Colaborative system

# The Content-based System
  By analyzing features such as genre, director, cast, plot keywords, and user ratings, the system can identify and recommend films that similarity with the movies that user watched.
# Colaborative system
  - User-base
  - Item-base
  - KNN
  - SVD++

| Recomendation System | RMSE  | MAPE | MAE |
| -------------------  | ----- | ---- | --- |
| Baseline User-based CF  | 1.7188 | 40.5585 | 1.3484 |
| Baseline Item-based CF  | 2.5511 | 64.0379 | 2.2585 |
| SVD++  | 0.8806 | 64.0379 | 20.3463 | 0.6770 |
